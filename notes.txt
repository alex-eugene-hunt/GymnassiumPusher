--- Notes related to machine learning algorithms ---
I will start with these 5 main topics and will delve into various variants

1. Q-Learning
    - Tabular Q-Learning
    - Deep Q-Learning
    - Prioritized Experience Replay

2. Deep Q-Network (DQN)
    - Standard DQN
    - Double DQN (DDQN)
    - Dueling DQN
    - Rainbow DQN
    - Noisy DQN

3. Policy Gradient Methods
    - Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG)
    - Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
    - Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
    - REINFORCE

4. Actor Critic Methods
    - Basic Actor Critic
    - Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)
    - Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)
    - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
    - Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)
    - Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)

5. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
    - Standard PPO

6. Model-Based RL
    - Dyna-Q
    - Model Predictive Control (MPC)
    - World Models
