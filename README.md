# GymnassiumPusher: Reinforcement Learning with MuJoCo Pusher Environment

## Project Overview
This project implements a reinforcement learning agent for the Pusher environment from Gymnasium (formerly OpenAI Gym) using MuJoCo physics engine. The agent learns to control a robotic arm to push an object to a target location.

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **Gymnasium** - Reinforcement learning environment framework
- **MuJoCo** - Physics engine for robot simulation
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations and array operations

### Environment Details
The Pusher environment is a robotic simulation where:
- A 7-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) robotic arm must push an object to a target location
- The environment uses MuJoCo physics engine for accurate physical simulations
- The state space includes joint angles, velocities, and target/object positions
- The action space consists of torques applied to the robot's joints

## Technical Implementation

### Environment Specifications
- **Observation Space**: 23-dimensional continuous space
  - Robot joint angles and velocities
  - Object and target positions
  - Distance measurements
- **Action Space**: 7-dimensional continuous space
  - Joint torques for the robotic arm
- **Reward Function**: Based on:
  - Distance between object and target
  - Distance between robot end-effector and object
  - Control cost for actions

### Key Components
1. **MuJoCo Integration**
   - Utilizes MuJoCo physics engine for realistic robot dynamics
   - XML-based model definition for the robot and environment
   - Accurate collision detection and contact dynamics

2. **Gymnasium Framework**
   - Built on the Gymnasium RL framework
   - Standardized environment interface
   - Compatible with popular RL libraries
